The tour is over and I'm goin' homeHome to my baby, the bike of my ownSo good to hear her, so nice and so cleanHard to believe it, she's just like a dreamWe're drivin' out to the countrysideBuy a sixpack we've got the timeI'm gonna tell my girl to move'Cause I've got real love to proveAnytime I wanna, everytime I canI'll escape on my Harley-DavidsonAnytime I wanna, everytime I canI'll escape on the highwayGonna get married as soon as we canWhen I tell the church, the shit hits the fanI'm gonna buy her all the gas she needsFill her up with lve, burning on the wheelsWe're drivin' out to the countrysideMakin' love in the morning lightDon't have to pray for her to stay'Cause I've got my bike anywayFire!Plop!
