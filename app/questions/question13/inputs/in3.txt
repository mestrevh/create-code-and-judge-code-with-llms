Aldous Huxley was a humanist and pacifist, and he was latterly interested
in spiritual subjects such as parapsychology and philosophical mysticism.
[1] He is also well known for advocating and taking psychedelics.
By the end of his life Huxley was considered, in some academic circles,
a leader of modern thought and an intellectual of the highest rank,
 and highly regarded as one of the most prominent explorers of visual
 communication and sight-related theories as well.[2]
