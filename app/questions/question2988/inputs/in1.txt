HELLO STONEHENGE!!
Who takes The Pandorica takes the universe!
But, bad news, everyone, cuz guess who!! Ha!
Except, you lot, you’re all… whizzing about… it’s really VERY distracting
could you all just stay still for a minute, because I!!! AM!!! TALKING!!!!!
Now: The question of the hour is, who’s got The Pandorica.
Answer: I do. 
Next question! Who’s coming to take it from me?
C’MMMONN, LOOK at me! No plan, no backup, no weapons worth a damn
OH, and — something else — I. Don’t. Have. Anything TO LOSE.
So, if you’re sitting up there in your silly little spaceship with all…your…silly…little guns…
and you’ve got any plans on taking The Pandorica TONIGHT
just REMEMBER who’s standing in your way.
REMEMBER every black day I ever stopped you
and then, AND. THEN. ANNND THEN...
DO the SMART THING…
let somebody else try first.
