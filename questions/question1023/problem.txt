Título: Grid Colouring
Topicos do problema: grafo; flood fill; 
Descrição: <p>A set of contours is represented on a two dimensional grid as illustrated in the sample below. Thecontours are made of any printable character different than space and ‘ ’ (underscore). In the samplethis character is ‘X’. All the other points of the grid are represented by spaces and marking characters.A grid zone is defined as the set of points enclosed within a closed contour such that any two zonepoints can be connected by a path which does not cross any contour and whose segments run verticallyor horizontally. A zone is marked if it contains identical characters, called marking characters, differentthan space and the character used to draw the grid contours. No zone can contain different markingcharacters. However, observe that while all the contours are drawn with the same character, themarkings of different zones can be different. A zone is unmarked if it contains only spaces. Any gridzone can be either marked or unmarked and the marking characters can appear inside grid zones only.Write a program to fill all the marked zones on each grid read from the input file. A marked zoneis filled with its marking character, as shown in the sample<br/></p>
Formato da entrada: <p>On input, each grid is terminated by a separation line full of underscores ‘ ’. There are at most 30 linesand at most 80 characters in a line for each grid. The lines can be of different length.<br/></p>
Formato da saída: <p>The standard output file contains the painted grids. Each grid is output in the same format it is readfrom the input file, including the separation line, blank lines and possible leading or trailing spaces.<br/></p>
