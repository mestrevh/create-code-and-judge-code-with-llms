Okay then. That's what I'll do
I will tell you a story. Can you hear them?
All these people who lived in terror of you and your judgement.
All these people who's ancestors devoted themselves, sacrificed themselves to you.
Can you hear them singing? Oh, you like to think you're a god.
You're not a god, you're just a parasite, eaten out with jealousyand envy and longing for the lives of other.
You feed on them, on the memory of love and loss and birth and death and joy and sorrow! 
So... So... Come on, then. 
Take mine. Take my memories.
But I hope you've got a big appetite because I've lived a long life
and I've seen a few things. 
I walked away from the Last Great Time War.
I marked the passing of the Time Lords.
I saw the birth of the universe and I watched as time ran out
moment by moment
until nothing remained.
No time. No space. Just me.
I walked in universes where the laws of physics were devised by the mind of a madman.
I've watched universes freeze and creations burn.
I have seen things you wouldn't believe.
I have lost things you will never understand.
And I know things, secrets that must never be told
and knowledge that must never be spoken.
Knowledge that will make parasite gods blaze.
So come on then! Take it! Take it all, baby!
Have it! You have it all!
