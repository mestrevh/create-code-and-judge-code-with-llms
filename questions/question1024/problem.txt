Título: Critical Links
Topicos do problema: grafo; 
Descrição: <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In a computer network a link L, which interconnects two servers, is considered critical if there are at</div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">least two servers A and B such that all network interconnection paths between A and B pass through L.</div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Removing a critical link generates two disjoint sub{networks such that any two servers of a sub{network</div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">are interconnected. For example, the network shown in figure 1 has three critical links that are marked</div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">bold: 0 - 1,3 - 4, and 6 - 7.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://www.thehuxley.com/api/v1/problems/image/c59bc5981b580591bb6e86683cfd319fa3039efch.png"/></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It is known that:</div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1. the connection links are bi{directional;</div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2. a server is not directly connected to itself;</div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">3. two servers are interconnected if they are directly connected or if they are interconnected with</div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">the same server;</div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">4. the network can have stand{alone sub{networks.</div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Write a program that finds all critical links of a given computer network.</div>
Formato da entrada: <p>The first line contains a positive integer no_of_servers(possibly 0) which is the number of network servers. The next no_of_servers lines. one for each server in the network, are randomly ordered and show the way servers are connected. the line corresponding to serverk, 0 &lt;= k &lt;= no_of_servers - 1, specifies the number of direct connections of serverk and the server which are directly connected to serverk. Servers are represented by integers from 0 to no_of_servers-1. Input data are correct. The first data set from sample input below corresponds to the network in figure 1, while the second data set specifies an empty network.<br/></p><p>There are multiple test cases, and they will be separated by a single blank space.</p>
Formato da saída: <p>The result of the program is on standard output. For each data set the program prints the number of critical links and the critical links, one link per line, starting from the beginning of the line, as shown in the sample output below. The links are listed in ascending order according to their first element. The output for the data set is followed by an empty line.<br/></p>
